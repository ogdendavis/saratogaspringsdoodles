Hi, my name is Andrea. I was born and raised in Sandy Utah and currently live in Saratoga Springs Utah. I started out as a guardian home for my Mable, a standard poodle, and ended up helping whelp a litter for the breeders. Through that experience, I fell in love with the whole breeding process. I have always loved dogs, and deeply enjoy using my experience and knowledge as an OB Tech at a local hospital helping deliver babies into this world to help me breed top-quality, genetic health tested puppies. My husband and I have 5 kids two boys and 3 girls and they love helping me with all the puppies and socialization and enrichment play with them. My husband gets to work from home so we always have eyes and ears on the puppies.
