  Nutrition is very important to make sure a dog lives the longest, healthiest
  life possible. I use and strongly recommend
  [pawTree](https://www.pawtree.com/andreasaunders) products. (Use code Intro4u
  to save 20% off your first order)


  Your dog's food shouldn't just help them survive -- it should help them thrive! Dogs need quality nutrition to be at their best. We recommend foods that have real meat as the first ingredient; are responsibly sourced; and **don't** contain meat by-products, artificial colors or preservatives, added sugar or other sweeteners, corn, wheat, or soy.


  Similarly, treats should be made from real meat or offal (animal organs), and shouldn't contain preservatives or artificial flavors.


  Take a look at some of my recommended products below, or shop [my store](https://www.pawtree.com/andreasaunders) to see all that pawTree has to offer.

  Training your puppy is also very important: If you are a new puppy owner or
  would like a refresher course, I have teamed up with [Baxter and
  Bella](https://www.baxterandbella.com/). Amy Jensen is the trainer behind
  Baxter and Bella -- she's a former teacher who has used her lesson planning
  and instructional skills to develop an amazing program that teaches you how to
  communicate with, socialize, and train your puppy.

  Most behavioral problems with puppies boil down to a lack of
  [training](/care-and-feeding/training), or boredom. Dogs, like people, need
  mental and physical exercise in order to be their best.


  Dogs interact with the world via their mouths, so chew toys are a great way to give them something to do -- and something to eat other than your slippers. Puzzles and snuffle mats are also great ways to keep your dog mentally engaged.


  Of course, your puppy is happiest when you're interacting with them. Training time is good bonding, but it's also nice to have some more relaxed, less structured, play time with your pup. Interactive toys such as ropes (for tug of war) and balls (for fetch) are wonderful tools to help you engage with your dog. Additionally, a regular grooming routine is a great way to not only keep your pup clean, but build a bond with them.


  Dogs need more sleep than people do -- generally around 12 hours a day. So it's important that your dog has comfortable, safe places to nap throughout the day. This gives your dog a feeling of security, and lets them rest up so they can be their best once nap time is over.
