At Saratoga Springs Doodles, we strive to provide only the best for our adult breeding dogs, who are also loving members of our family. To ensure that we are able to give these dogs the best possible home life while being able to produce the best possible puppies, we limit the number of dogs we have living in our home. We are offering a guardian program where qualified families will receive a puppy/dog while we retain the breeding rights. Cost is $1,000, which will be returned at the end of the dogs breeding time.

Guardian families are expected to properly care for their new puppy/dog physically and financially. We will cover all costs associated with breeding, and we will house and own all litters produced by guardian family dogs. Basically, you will get an adorable dog to add to your family, and we get to use him/her in our breeding program. Pretty simple! Guardian dogs will remain your forever family pet but will come to us every so often to sire/whelp their litters.

## Qualifications

Guardian families must have:

* A fenced yard
* Previous experience with owning a dog, or proven extensive knowledge of caring for a dog

Guardian families must be able to:

* Provide a puppy/dog with proper health care, nutrition, and exercise
* Properly train and socialize a puppy/dog with appropriate tools and methods
* Keep up with grooming (both professionally and at home), including regular brushing/bathing

Guardian families must live within 30 minutes of Saratoga Springs, Ut

### Owning a female guardian dog

Your dog will stay with me for a few days during the breeding process, and for the duration of whelping a litter. Once old enough, female dogs will spend at least 6-8 weeks in our care to whelp, raise, and wean their puppies (guardian families are always welcome to visit during this time) 1-2 times per year. Guardians must be able to detect a heat cycle and keep females away from intact male dogs during this time. Females retire at around the age of 4-6 (typically after having 3-4 litters). After retirement, the female will be spayed and continue to live the remainder of her life with her guardian family.

### Owning a male guardian dog

Male dogs will be brought to us as needed during the breeding process. Guardians must be able to keep male dogs away from intact female dogs in heat. Males retire at around the age of 5-7. After retirement, the male will be neutered and continue to live the remainder of his life with his guardian family.

## Other Requirements

​* We ask that you allow us to make arrangements to pick up the puppy/dog throughout various stages in its life to get photos taken to display on our website/social media channels.

* Guardian dogs are to be kept on a healthy diet at all times, including feeding our chosen food brand.
* Guardian families are required to take their puppy/dog to the vet for its annual vaccines and whenever else needed (aside from breeding related visits).
* Guardian dogs will keep their given name, although you may have as many nicknames for them as you like.
* For Bernedoodles: We ask that you let the puppy’s coat grow out until around 6-12 months, although hair around the face, on the belly, and under the tail must be kept trimmed. Brushing and bathing should be done regularly.
