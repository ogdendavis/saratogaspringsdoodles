This will be Skye’s first litter! She is the sweetest little lady and goes with her mama to her dance studio almost everyday. She has a very sweet and calm personality. Kobe is also a tiny boy that has the sweetest smile. Can’t wait to see these puppies. Skye and Kobe have honeymooned and is due August 10th!
